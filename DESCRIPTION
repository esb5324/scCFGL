Description: This method builds upon scLink and CFGL and is based on the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) framework, representing genes as nodes and their coexpression relationships as edges in the resulting estimated network. This method is tailored for single-cell gene expression data and allows for the joint estimation of networks, effectively accounting for heterogeneity across biological conditions. This method facilitates meaningful comparisons of gene relationships across different biological states, thereby enhancing our ability to extract biological insights from single-cell genomics data.
